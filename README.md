# wikiPageClicker
A web scraper that uses BeautifulSoup to play the wikipedia game.
You give it an article to start with and an article to end with. 
Then it will start at the first article and follow links to other articles until it reaches the end article.
Once it's done, it will print out a of all the articles it followed representing its path from start to finish. 
When the program starts, it will ask for a start and end article. You can enter the articles or just press enter to use the defaults.
The default start article is Garfield and the default end article is Count Dracula.
Alternatively, you can pass articles as command line arguments.
use the [-a] flag to designate the start article and the [-b] flag to designate the end article.
Happy gaming!
